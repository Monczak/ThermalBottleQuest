Thermoses can keep drinks warm thanks to a seal inside the walls, which is usually made of glass.
The precursor of today's thermal bottle was called a "vacuum flask" and was invented in 1892 by Sir James Dewar.
In 1904, two German glass blowers formed a company for producing thermal bottles, which was called Thermos GmbH.
A competition was held to name the vacuum bottle, which was the precursor to the thermos. A local resident submitted the word "thermos" derived from a Greek word for heat.
The thermos played an important role in World War II, since British military forces had them in their equipment.
Nowadays thermoses have hollow walls, which are filled with vacuum. This way there is next to no heat transfer between the inside and the outside, which makes drinks stay warm!
Not only are thermoses used to store hot liquids, but they can also store extremely cold liquids as well. There are special thermoses used for storing liquid nitrogen, oxygen or even liquid helium.
Thermoses aren't the cheapest liquid containers. But the fact that they keep things warm alone makes them worth it!
